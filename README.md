# PowerBI_Projects

Showcasing some of the PowerBI dashboards I've created using Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) methodologies used in Data Analytics. The projects include:

a) Comprehensive KPIs: Displays total sales, profit, quantity sold, and customer count for high-level business monitoring.

b) Segmented Analysis: Breaks down sales and profit by product category, sub-category, customer segment, and region, enabling granular performance insights.

c) Time Series Trends: Visualizes sales and profit trends by year, quarter, and month to identify growth patterns and seasonality.

d) Geographical Insights: Highlights regional performance and pinpoints top and underperforming areas.

e) Interactive Filtering: Empowers users to drill down by state, category, or segment using slicers and filters.

f) Data Storytelling: Uses bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs for intuitive data exploration and actionable business intelligence.

  This project showcases my ability to transform raw transactional data into actionable insights for strategic decision-making in retail and  e-commerce environments.

*** Datasets used for the projects have been sourced from Kaggle which are as follows - ***
1) Walmart sales dataset
2) Financial sample dataset
